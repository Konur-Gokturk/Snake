Hey,

My name is Konuralp, and I'm 13 years old. This is a Snake game code written in Python.
To run the code, you'll need to install Python and add it to your Path.
Next, you'll need an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). 
I would recommend using PyCharm (Community or Professional Edition) since I wrote and tested it flawlessly on PyCharm. Visual Studio Code, also known as VScode, should work fine as well.
